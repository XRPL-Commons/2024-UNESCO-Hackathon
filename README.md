## Rules

Build on Mainnet and XRPL EM Sidechain
All projects must have a component on mainnet

4 criteria are equaly weighted
- idea (the originality of the idea)
- implementation (the quality of the code and soundness of the architecture)
- demo (how well you articulate your solution for the user)
- potential (the total value transacted on chain, the business model, and the potential reach)
